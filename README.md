# Password_hashing

This is a simple password hashing tool created for educational purposes. It demonstrates a basic password hashing technique using the SHA-256 algorithm. Please note that this tool is not intended for production use or storing real passwords. It is solely meant to provide an educational example of how password hashing works.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Run the script `password_hashing_tool.py` in a Python environment.

3. Enter a password when prompted.

4. The script will generate a salt value, combine it with the password, and hash the salted password using SHA-256.

5. The resulting hashed password will be displayed on the console.

## Important Note

- This password hashing tool should not be used for real-world applications or to store actual passwords. It is a basic example created for educational purposes only.

- When dealing with real-world password storage, it is crucial to use well-established libraries and frameworks that implement secure and tested password hashing algorithms.

- In practice, you should never store passwords in plaintext or invent custom password hashing algorithms. Always follow industry best practices and security guidelines.
